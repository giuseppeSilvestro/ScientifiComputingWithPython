In January I joined the Open University and I started a Bachelor's in Data Science. I have decided to lear a new programming language while I study the Math module to be ready when I will be studying other modules that will involve programming. This repository is to collect all the files that I am creating while following the course on FreeCodeCamp and TeamTreeHouse.
